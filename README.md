A high-performance, asynchronous request/response processing framework for Rust, designed for building robust HTTP servers and microservices with configurable handler chains and routing.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Built on top of `tokio` for high-performance async request handling
- **Configurable Handler Chains**: Define request, termination, and response handlers with flexible chaining
- **Multiple Routing Strategies**: Support for path-based and header-based routing
- **Exchange System**: Generic exchange abstraction for request/response processing
- **Caching Support**: Built-in caching mechanisms with `dashmap` for thread-safe operations
- **HTTP Support**: First-class support for HTTP via Hyper integration
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based configuration with builder patterns
- **Thread-Safe**: Designed for concurrent processing with thread-safe data structures

## Architecture

Idemio follows a modular architecture with the following core components:

- **Exchange**: Generic container for request/response data with metadata and attachments
- **Handlers**: Async trait-based processing units that can be chained together
- **Router**: Routes requests to appropriate handler chains based on configuration
- **Executor**: Manages the execution flow of handler chains
- **Factory**: Creates exchanges from incoming requests
- **Registry**: Manages handler registration and lookup

## Dependencies

This project uses the following major dependencies:

- **tokio** Async runtime
- **hyper** HTTP implementation
- **dashmap** Concurrent hash map
- **serde** Serialization framework
- **thiserror** Error handling
- **uuid** UUID generation
- **async-trait** Async traits
- **fnv** Fast hash function

## Performance

The framework is designed for high performance with:

- Lock-free data structures using `dashmap`
- Efficient routing with FNV hashing
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Configurable handler execution strategies
